bluepintr is a plugin to [drake](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) that adds automated steps for tabular dataset documentation and testing. Designed for social science research projects, this package creates a framework to build trust in your data and to prevent programming issues from affecting your analysis results.

## Usage

Define blueprints of your data using `blueprint()`. Blueprints combine drake target commands with some extra metadata about the output tabular dataset, including the name and description of the data.

```{r}
library(blueprintr)

blueprint1 <- blueprint(
  "blueprint1",
  description = "My first blueprint",
  command = {
    # Put all code related to building this dataset here
    mtcars
  }
)

blueprint1
```

Refer to other datasets using `.TARGET()` to guarantee that parent datasets are also tested and documented. Run checks on the dataset entirely with the `checks` parameter and define variable tests in the metadata files.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
no_missing_cyl <- function(df) {
  all(!is.na(df$cyl))
}

blueprint2 <- blueprint(
  "blueprint2",
  description = "My second blueprint that depends on another",
  checks = check_list(
    no_missing_cyl()
  ),
  command =
    .TARGET("blueprint1") %>% 
      filter(cyl == 4)
)
```

Once all blueprints are defined, attach them to a plan using `attach_blueprint()` or `attach_blueprints()` so drake can run the needed tasks.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
library(drake)

plan_from_blueprint(blueprint1) %>% 
  attach_blueprint(blueprint2)
```

drake handles the code execution based on the targets generated by blueprintr.

## Installation

As `blueprintr` is not yet on CRAN, you must install the package from this repository:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Global-TIES-for-Children/blueprintr")
```
